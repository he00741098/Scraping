It results in incontinence or retention of the urine depending on the synergy of bladder smooth muscles and urethral sphincter. There can also be a condition where retention causes overflow incontinence. Retention of urine in this condition is caused by relative lack of contractility of bladder smooth muscles in response to the stretch reflex. As a result, there is no urge and therefore the bladder remains over-distended causing retention of urine. Currently, there are no absolute ways to deal with such a situation except that the patients are advised for self-help techniques of regularly evacuating the bladder. Pharmacotherapy for such condition is not promising. As the patients of neurogenic bladder are often healthy otherwise (with manageable conditions such as diabetes), a bladder dysfunction is considered as a disability that they do not want to share. In this state, any approach that offers a regeneration of bladder reflex and restoration of its functions is more than one can expect for.","","Methods.","","An elderly male suffering with chronic urinary retention recommended for indwelling catheterization after the failure of voiding trial following the possible conventional pharmacotherapy was treated with Ayurvedic therapy.","","Results.","","There was a complete symptom reversal after about 45 days of Ayurvedic therapy. The changes were stable after 3-month follow-up of the patient.","","Conclusion.","","This case report presents the complete symptom reversal in a case of chronic urine retention as an outcome of Ayurvedic therapy. Seeing the importance of this clinical condition and unavailability of sufficient means in conventional medicine, it requires a serious note and enquiry into its applicability in similar cases."],"license_agreement":"This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).","keywords":["alternative medicine","Ayurveda","complementary and alternative medicine"],"doi":"10.1177/2156587217712764"},{"title":"Determinants of Prakriti, the Human Constitution Types of Indian Traditional Medicine and its Correlation with Contemporary Science","publication_info":[{"name":"Harish Rotti","attributes":[],"email":null},{"name":"Ritu Raval","attributes":[],"email":null},{"name":"Suchitra Anchan","attributes":["Department of Shalyatantra/Roganidana, Shri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara College of Ayurveda, Udupi, Karnataka, India"],"email":null},{"name":"Ravishankara Bellampalli","attributes":[],"email":null},{"name":"Sameer Bhale","attributes":["Department of Biotechnology, Sinhgad College of Engineering, University of Pune, Pune, Maharashtra, India"],"email":null},{"name":"Ramachandra Bharadwaj","attributes":["Centre for Clinical Research, Foundation for Revitalization of Local Health Traditions, Bangalore, Karnataka, India"],"email":null},{"name":"Balakrishna K.

As the clinical presentation is found to vary widely, research papers reporting clinical symptoms of patient samples from different parts of the world were also reviewed to identify outliers and atypical presentations. Case records of fourteen COVID-19 patients treated at Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon were analyzed to compare symptomatology with data obtained from published literature. Further, a careful correlation was done with the data collected from selected Ayurvedic classical texts and expert views of clinical practitioners to arrive at a preliminary Ayurvedic clinical profile of COVID-19.","","Results","","COVID-19 can be understood from the Ayurvedic perspective as vÄtakapha dominant sannipÄtajvara of Ägantu origin with pittÄnubandha.

The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may significantly affect a patientâs quality of life and can be associated with conditions such as fatigue, headache, cognitive impairment, and sleep disturbances. Various complementary and alternative medicine treatments have been used for this condition in clinical practice. The Ayurveda system of medicine is the most common complementary medicine system practiced in Sri Lanka. The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of a decoction used in traditional Ayurveda for allergic rhinitis and its ready- to-use freeze dried formulation in comparison to an antihistamine over a period of 4âweeks on relief of symptoms in allergic rhinitis.","","Study design","","This is a three-arm, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled clinical trial enrolling patients with AR. Tamalakyadi decoction containing 12 ingredients (TMD12), used in traditional Ayurveda and its freeze-dried formulation are the test products. The efficacy and safety of the two Ayurvedic dosage forms will be tested against the antihistamine loratadine. Patients with symptoms of AR will be allocated randomly into the three arms after a 1-week run-in period and the medications will be given orally for 28âdays. Total Nasal symptom Score (TNSS) of the patients will be used as the primary efficacy endpoint. TNSS will be recorded and compared between the three arms prior to visit 1, at the end of 28âdays, and end of the first and second months of follow-up.

The only literature relevant to the treatment of Coronavirus disease has surfaced from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM which was extensively used to control the epidemic in China, also consists of herbal medicines similar to Ayurveda. In this case, the patient, who was familiar with the use of Ayurvedic medicines, fully aware that no proven cure exists in MWM, decided to entirely rely on the limited Ayurvedic medicines that he had in his possession at the time of falling ill.","","Despite the patient presenting with symptoms, namely high fever, severe body pain and severe cough, along with many of the other associated symptoms of COVID-19, the progress of the disease could be arrested within a short period by being exclusively on Ayurvedic medicines. This illustrates that there is a wide scope to explore the variety of pertinent medicines present in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia which can be used more rationally to suit every stage of the disease.","","Being the first-of-its-kind it is a valuable contribution to scientific literature from the world of Ayurveda.

Experimental animals received HK and MMK orally from day 0 to day 14 and histamine (1Â mg/kg b.w/i.v) and 1Â % evans blue (EB) (0.1Â mL) via tail vein on day 14. The compound 48/80 (intracutaneous) challenged mice model followed the same technique. The former mimicked acute anaphylaxis and the latter mast cell degranulation. For both models, EB dye leakage was quantified spectrophotometrically to determine vascular permeability. Plasma histamine was measured in Compound 48/80-induced animals using LC-ESI-MS/MS. The guineapig received HK and MMK p.o. and 0.6Â % histamine sprayed in a histamine chamber to simulate allergic rhinitis. Blood eosinophil count and sneeze rate were measured in histamine-challenged guineapigs. Goat R.B.C. membrane stability assay (mammalian cell membrane toxicity) and intracellular histamine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ release assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were performed in vitro. For both histamine and Compound 48/80 challenged animals, HK (22.81Â % and 14.58Â %) and MMK (19.71Â % and 22.40Â %) significantly reduced EB dye leakage (pÂ <Â 0.05). Both formulations, HK and MMK considerably (pÂ <Â 0.05) decreased plasma histamine (29.62Â % and 25.37Â % respectively) in mice and eosinophilic count (11.56Â % and 9.94Â % respectively) and sneeze rate (42.58Â % and 29.03Â % respectively) in guinea pigs. In membrane stability experiment, HK and MMK reduced RBC lysis. Both HK and MMK raw/dialysate blocked CHO cell cytosolic Ca2+ release. HK and MMK activities mimic mast cell stabilization with possible H1 receptor inactivation seen by decreased Ca2+ efflux and thus indicate potential for allergic rhinitis management. The combination of activities is usually related with curative and prophylactic therapy and might lead future clinical trials and therapies."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).","keywords":["Polyherbal drug formulations","Histamine & H1 receptor","Mast cell","Intracellular Calcium","Allergy","in vivo study"],"doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31937"},{"title":"Ayurvedic management of a refractory skin disease clinically diagnosed as Cutaneous Lichen PlanusâA case report","publication_info":[{"name":"Sushma Naranappa Salethoor","attributes":["Amrita Centre for Advanced Research in Ayurveda, Amrita School of Ayurveda, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, Kerala, India"],"email":null},{"name":"Shyamasundaran Kulangara","attributes":["Amrita Centre for Advanced Research in Ayurveda, Amrita School of Ayurveda, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, Kerala, India"],"email":null},{"name":"A.R.

This study aims at using this ancient wisdom to diagnose the medical conditions and to study about their prognosis, and studying about how it can be applied to modern medical practice and its limitations. For the purpose of the study, 30 volunteers were divided into 3 groups. Group I consisting of healthy volunteers, group II of those patients who suffer from curable conditions and group III consisting of patients suffering from chronic diseases which can be regarded as incurable. The urine collection, oil drop instillation and evaluation, were all done according to the guidelines laid down in Ayurvedic practices. Upon the evaluation of the color, appearance, consistency and pattern of oil drop spreading in different patients of different groups, it could be seen that the data could be correlated to what has been provided in the literature in majority of the cases. In today's modern medical practices, there is a plethora of urine diagnostic examinations available. These act as an added financial burden to the patients. In the midst of this, making use of Tailabindu pariksha for urine examination, will not only prove economical, but also is a time-tested and scientifically proven method.

Based on clinical features like Keshadhwansha (hair fall) with Harsha (hypersensitivity), Kandu (itching), Toda (pain), FD can be correlated with Raktaja Krimi Vikara (RKV).","","Observation and results","","A 24 years' male patient with the chief complaint of patchy hair loss in the scalp region associated with scale formation, itching, and pain for 2 months. He had a history of pustules-like eruption over the frontal and parietal regions. He tried various topical and oral medications for 8 days but didn't get any sign of improvement and came to NIA hospital for Ayurveda treatment. Due to the signs like pustules over the scalp, hair loss with honey-colored crusting, scarring, mild itching, and pain; he was diagnosed with RKVÂ â¼Â FD. After treatment with Ayurveda medicine and leech therapy, complete remission of the scar, lesions, itching, pain, and hair loss was obtained, and there was new hair growth over the scalp with normal distribution. The patient was on follow-up for 33 months with no signs of itching, pain, and hair fall.","","Conclusion","","Complete remission of FD was achieved by Ayurveda medicine along with Jalaukavacharana and it seems highly effective on the basis of remission period compared to contemporary treatment modalities.

Of the several reasons, phenotypic heterogeneity seems to be a likely contributor for missing out genetic associations of large effects. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine is one such tool which adopts a holistic deep phenotyping approach and classifies individuals based on their body constitution/prakriti. We hypothesized that Ayurveda based phenotypic stratification of healthy and diseased individuals will allow us to achieve much desired homogeneous cohorts which would facilitate detection of genetic association of large effects. In this proof of concept study, we performed a genome wide association testing of clinically diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls, who were re-phenotyped into Vata, Pitta and Kapha predominant prakriti sub-groups.","","Experimental procedure","","Genotypes of rheumatoid arthritis cases (VataÂ =Â 49; PittaÂ =Â 117; KaphaÂ =Â 78) and controls (VataÂ =Â 33; PittaÂ =Â 175; KaphaÂ =Â 85) were retrieved from the total genotype data, used in a recent genome-wide association study performed in our laboratory. A total of 528461 SNPs were included after quality control. Prakriti-wise genome-wide association analysis was employed.","","Results and conclusion","","This study identified (i) prakriti-specific novel disease risk genes of high effect sizes; (ii) putative candidates of novel therapeutic potential; and (iii) a good correlation between genetic findings and clinical knowledge in Ayurveda. Adopting Ayurveda based deep phenotyping may facilitate explaining hitherto undiscovered heritability in complex traits and may propel much needed progress in personalized medicine."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).","keywords":["Rheumatoid arthritis","Ayurgenomics","Ayurveda","Genome-wide association study","P4 medicine"],"doi":"10.1016/j.jaim.2022.100578"},{"title":"âClasses beyond the walls\" â A reexploring method of teaching in ayurveda education over conventional approach","publication_info":[{"name":"Geeta G.

However, the efficacy of TC in treating alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and its mechanism remain largely unknown. This study evaluated the hepatoprotective effects of different doses of TC as well as to identify the bioactive components and determine their mechanism of action against ethanol-induced ALD. A compound-target network analysis model of TC was established to identify its potential bioactive compounds and pathways that might regulate its hepatoprotective effects. Further, in-vivo studies were performed to validate the potential of TC (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg b.w.) in the treatment and management of ALD. The study revealed that both the dosages of TC demonstrate significant (p > 0.0001) hepatoprotective effects by improving body weight, total bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum alkaline phosphate (ALP), total cholesterol, total protein, globulin, albumin, and liver morphology. The High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) fingerprinting of TC showed the presence of piperine. Network pharmacology identifies the role of TC in regulating various signaling processes including Advanced glycation end products-receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE), Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1), Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-Kappa B), and Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling to exert its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic role in managing ALD. Based on the bioinformatics analysis, some of the key targets of TC were found to be Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 (PTGS2) or Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Sirtuin 1 (SRT1), and caspase-3. These effects may serve as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of ALD. These preclinical validation studies for the ethnopharmacological potential of TC in ALD treatment further paved the way for researchers to perform next-level translational and clinical studies. Further, in-depth experimental studies for the validation of these bioinformatics-based results will give a clearer picture of mechanisms."],"license_agreement":"This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).

Pain is the most common symptom which is often described as burning. Conventional pain management is the only treatment option for iSFN, which is only modestly effective and associated with adverse events which lead to reduced drug compliance. It also affects the overall quality of life. This case report discusses the effect of Ayurvedic interventions in the management of iSFN. The patient was a 37-year-old male, who presented with severe pain, burning, and tingling sensation of B/L lower limbs and hands with decreased sleep for 5 years (visual analogue scale (VAS) was 10 and neuropathic pain scale (NPS) score was 39). Considering the signs and symptoms, the disease was diagnosed under the Vata Vyadhi (disease/syndrome caused by Vata Dosha) spectrum. The treatment included an initial OPD-based Shamana (treatment that pacifies the aggravated doshas) treatment with Drakshadi Kwatha, Sundibaladwaya Ksheera Kwatha, Kalyanaka Gritha, and Ashwagandhadi Churna. As the symptoms persisted, Shodhana (treatment in which aggravated doshas are expelled from the body) treatment was adopted which included Mridu (mild) Shodhana, Nasya (medicine administered through nasal route) and Basti (administration of medicine through the procto-colonic route). The intervention resulted in significant clinical improvement as evidenced by the reduction in VAS and NPS scores to zero and five respectively.

Hence, evidence-based research is highly needed for global recognition and acceptance of Ayurveda, which needs further advancements in the research methodology. The present review highlights various fields of research including literary, fundamental, drug, pharmaceutical, and clinical research in Ayurveda. The review further focuses to improve the research methodology for Ayurveda with main emphasis on the fundamental research. This attempt will certainly encourage young researchers to work on various areas of research for the development and promotion of Ayurveda."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.","keywords":["Ayurvedic research and methodology","personalized medicine","Rasayana","traditional medicine"],"doi":"10.4103/0974-8520.190699"},{"title":"Potential implications of Ayurveda in Psoriasis: A clinical case study","publication_info":[{"name":"Guruprasad C.

To the best of our knowledge, no study has convincingly correlated genomic variations with the classification of Prakriti. In the present study, we performed genome-wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis (Affymetrix, 6.0) of 262 well-classified male individuals (after screening 3416 subjects) belonging to three Prakritis. We found 52 SNPs (pââ¤â1âÃâ10â5) were significantly different between Prakritis, without any confounding effect of stratification, after 106 permutations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of these SNPs classified 262 individuals into their respective groups (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) irrespective of their ancestry, which represent its power in categorization. We further validated our finding with 297 Indian population samples with known ancestry. Subsequently, we found that PGM1 correlates with phenotype of Pitta as described in the ancient text of Caraka Samhita, suggesting that the phenotypic classification of Indiaâs traditional medicine has a genetic basis; and its Prakriti-based practice in vogue for many centuries resonates with personalized medicine."],"license_agreement":"This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

The participants were asymptomatic or mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. Guduchighana Vati 500 mg twice daily for 10 days was administered in the study group and Hydroxychloroquine for 5 days in the control group. Paracetamol, Vitamin C, Multivitamin, and Zinc were also provided in the control group. The main outcome measures were to negative real-time reverse transcriptionâpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for COVID-19, proportion of participants with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 at 5th and 10th day, proportion of participants with clinical recovery, improvement in laboratory parameters, and incidence of adverse drug reaction/adverse event (ADR/AE). The results of RT-PCR and clinical recovery were compared between groups using Chi-square test. The data related to laboratory parameters were compared within group using paired sample t-test/Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between groups using independent sample t-test/MannâWhitney test.","","Results:","","The proportion of participants with negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 in the Guduchighana Vati group (93.3%) was better as compared to the control group (66.6%) till 10th day of the study period.

Cohen's weighted Îº statistic was used as a measure of intrarater and interrater reliability, and a hypothesis of homogeneous diagnosis (random rating) was tested. Following this, we tested whether proportions of ratings were equal between doctors.","","Results","","According to the Landis and Koch scale, the level of reliability ranged from poor to moderate.

By avoiding risk factors and applying existing evidence-based preventative techniques, 30%â50% of malignancies may be averted. In order to avoid cancer, it is essential to know the specific causes of the disease. Nidanas, or etiologies, are well-described in Ayurvedic science. Here, the causes of cancer have been outlined so that the knowledge may be used effectively to avoid the disease.","","Aims:","","Identification of cancer etiologies that have been described in classics. Evidence-based understanding of these etiologies and to comprehend the significance of etiologies in cancer prevention.","","Materials and methods:","","A thorough evaluation of literature, including ancient Ayurvedic classics, modern medical texts, and articles published in reputable journals, was conducted to meet the study's goals and objectives.","","Results:","","According to Ayurveda, there are three distinct phases of tumorigenesis: chronic inflammation, precancerous development, Granthi (a benign glandular swelli ng), and Arbuda (a precancerous tumor) (definite malignancy). A growing body of evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment, which is predominantly controlled by inflammatory cells, is an essential player in the neoplastic process.","","Conclusion:","","Although inflammation is coming into the picture just now in the contemporary world, Ayurveda has described this as a leading cause 5000 years back. It is evident that diet and lifestyle play a crucial role in the etiology of Shoth (inflammation)."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.","keywords":["Arbuda","Ayurvedic neoplasms","Granthi","Nidanaparivarjana","Shotha"],"doi":"10.4103/ayu.ayu_318_21"},{"title":"Scientific rationale of Indian AYUSH Ministry advisory for COVID-19 prevention, prophylaxis, and immunomodulation","publication_info":[{"name":"Prashant Kumar Gupta","attributes":["Department of Balroga, Shri NPA Govt.

Community periodontal index for treatment needs (CPITN) score was recorded, and oral prophylaxis was done for each patient. They were then randomly divided into 6 groups: control group (I), chlorhexidine (II), Khadiradi vati (III), Dashansanskar churana (IV), Neem (V), and Apamarga (VI); based on the drugs used by patients for the maintenance of oral hygiene after oral prophylaxis. Patients were recalled at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after oral prophylaxis. CPITN score was re-recorded for each patient at each follow-up. Reduction in CPITN score indicated improvement in the periodontal health.

Fibromyalgia (FMS) is a challenging condition for health care systems worldwide. Only limited trial data is available for FMS for outcomes of complex treatment interventions of complementary and integrative (CIM) approaches. Methods. We conducted a controlled, nonrandomized feasibility study that compared outcomes in 21 patients treated with Ayurveda with those of 11 patients treated with a conventional approach at the end of a two-week inpatient hospital stay. Primary outcome was the impact of fibromyalgia on patients as assessed by the FIQ. Secondary outcomes included scores of pain intensity, pain perception, depression, anxiety, and quality of sleep. Follow-up assessments were done after 6 months. Results. At 2 weeks, there were comparable and significant improvements in the FIQ and for most of secondary outcomes in both groups with no significant in-between-group differences. The beneficial effects for both treatment groups were partly maintained for the main outcome and a number of secondary outcomes at the 6-month followup, again with no significant in-between-group differences. Discussion. The findings of this feasibility study suggest that Ayurvedic therapy is noninferior to conventional treatment in patients with severe FMS. Since Ayurveda was only used as add-on treatment, RCTs on Ayurveda alone are warranted to increase model validity.

The currently available PD-therapeutics provide only symptomatic relief. Thus, there is an urgent need to devise an effective and safe treatment strategy for PD. The holistic approach of Ayurveda can be a potential effective strategy for treating PD. The integration of different medicine systems, such as modern bio-medicine and Ayurveda can be an effective strategy for treatment of complex diseases, including PD.","","Objective","","This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective mechanism of six Ayurvedic nootropics that are commonly used to treat PD.","","Material and methods","","Six Ayurvedic herbs, namely Mucuna pruriens (MP), Bacopa monnieri (BM), Withania somnifera (WS), Centella asiatica (CA), Sida cordifolia (SC), and Celastrus paniculatus (CP), were selected after consultation with Ayurvedic scholars and physicians. The mode of action of methanolic herbal extracts was evaluated using the Caenorhabditis elegans BZ555 and NL5901 strains, which can be used to model the two main hallmarks of PD, namely degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and aggregation of Î±-synuclein protein.","","Results","","All six herbal extracts exhibited neuroprotective effect. The extracts of BM and MP exhibited maximum protection against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+ iodide)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the BZ555 strain. Furthermore, the herbal extracts, except CA extract, inhibited the aggregation of heterologously expressed human Î±-synuclein in the NL5901 strain.","","Conclusion","","Ayurvedic herbs used in the treatment of PD exhibited differential neuroprotective and protein aggregation mitigating effects in C.Â elegans."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).","keywords":["Parkinsonâs disease","Ayurvedic nootropics","Caenorhabditis elegans","Dopaminergic neurons","Alpha-synuclein"],"doi":"10.1016/j.jaim.2020.07.006"},{"title":"Pharmacognostical study of Tamalaki (Phyllanthus fraternus Webster), a herb used in Tamaka-svasa","publication_info":[{"name":"Binay Sen","attributes":["Lecturer, Department of Agada Tantra and Vidhi Ayurveda, Government Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"email":"senbinay@yahoo.co.in"},{"name":"S.

The molecular hypoxia response pathway has been associated with such pathologies and our recent observations on anti-hypoxic and anti-inflammatory effects of whole aqueous extract of Adhatoda Vasica (AV) prompted us to explore its effects on relevant preclinical mouse models.","","Methods","","In this study, we tested the effect of whole aqueous extract of AV, in murine models of bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis, Cecum Ligation and Puncture (CLP) induced sepsis, and siRNA induced hypoxia-thrombosis phenotype. The effect on lung of AV treated naÃ¯ve mice was also studied at transcriptome level. We also determined if the extract may have any effect on SARS-CoV2 replication.","","Results","","Oral administration AV extract attenuates increased airway inflammation, levels of transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1), IL-6, HIF-1Î± and improves the overall survival rates of mice in the models of pulmonary fibrosis and sepsis and rescues the siRNA induced inflammation and associated blood coagulation phenotypes in mice. We observed downregulation of hypoxia, inflammation, TGF-Î²1, and angiogenesis genes and upregulation of adaptive immunity-related genes in the lung transcriptome. AV treatment also reduced the viral load in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV2.","","Conclusion","","Our results provide a scientific rationale for this ayurvedic herbal medicine in ameliorating the hypoxia-hyperinflammation features and highlights the repurposing potential of AV in COVID-19-like conditions.","","Supplementary Information","","The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12931-021-01698-9."],"license_agreement":"Open AccessThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

The 3 presenting Ayurvedic clinicians have approximately 50 years' combined experience practicing Ayurvedic medicine and have developed strategies for overcoming logistical and cultural challenges in working with patients. Ayurveda can be accessed for both acute and chronic conditions and includes multitarget therapies tailored to the unique constitution/imbalance profile of each patient, while accounting for any biomedical diagnoses. The focus of Ayurveda goes beyond symptom alleviation to the identification of the root cause of the imbalance and eventual resolution of the disorder. Ayurveda has a primary focus on modification of the diet and daily routine of the individual in an effort to create sustainable lifestyle change to promote overall health and prevent comorbid conditions. Ayurvedic clinicians also use herbal supplements, medicated oils, and hands-on manual therapies, as well as detoxification and rejuvenation therapies, to enhance healing holistically and synergistically and to create a state of durable well-being.","","The presenters of this workshop will focus on 3 key areas of Ayurvedic clinical practice: (1) Ayurvedic diet, daily routine, and yoga therapy (JR); (2) herbal therapies and home detoxification regimens (CE); and (3) manual therapies and Ayurvedic acupressure points (PV). Participants in the workshop will have the opportunity to (1) sample some simple medicinal teas and experience Ayurvedic dietary theory according to food qualities; (2) experience the effects of simple Ayurvedic breathing techniques and therapeutic yoga poses; and (3) participate in a basic demonstration of Ayurvedic manual therapies and acupressure."],"license_agreement":"This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial- No Derivative 3.0 License, which permits rights to copy, distribute and transmit the work for noncommercial purposes only, provided the original work is properly cited.","keywords":["None"],"doi":"10.7453/gahmj.2013.097CP.S19A"},{"title":"Ayurveda formulations: A roadmap to address the safety concerns","publication_info":[{"name":"Kishor Patwardhan","attributes":["Department of Kriya Sharir, Faculty of Ayurveda, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India"],"email":"patwardhan.kishor@gmail.com"},{"name":"Jigyasa Pathak","attributes":["Department of Dravyaguna, IPGT & RA, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India"],"email":null}],"PMCID":"PMCID: PMC5747514","abstract_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747514/?report=abstract","article_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747514/?report=classic","pdf_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5747514/pdf/main.pdf","abstract_text":["It is a matter of serious concern that the number of case reports pointing at a possible association between the clinical toxicity and the use of Ayurveda formulations is increasing significantly over the years in scientific medical literature.

A detailed review of available Ayurvedic literature was carried out to understand the physiology of blood pressure and etio-pathogenesis of hypertension from the perspective of Ayurveda. Many parallels were drawn from the concepts such as Shad Kriyakala (six stages of Dosha imbalance) and Avarana of Doshas (occlusion in the normal functioning of the Doshas) to the modern pathogenesis of hypertension to gain a deeper understanding of it. Hypertension without specific symptoms in its mild and moderate stages cannot be considered as a disease in Ayurveda. It appears to be an early stage of pathogenesis and a risk factor for development of diseases affecting the heart, brain, kidneys and eyes etc. Improper food habits and modern sedentary lifestyle with or without genetic predisposition provokes and vitiates all the Tridoshas to trigger the pathogenesis of hypertension. It is proposed that hypertension is to be understood as the Prasara-Avastha which means spread of vitiated Doshas from their specific sites, specifically of Vyana Vata, Prana Vata, Sadhaka Pitta and Avalambaka Kapha along with Rakta in their disturbed states. The Avarana (occlusion of normal functioning) of Vata Dosha by Pitta and Kapha can be seen in the Rasa-Rakta Dhathus, which in turn hampers the functioning of the respective Srotas (micro-channels) of circulation."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).","keywords":["Hypertension","Ayurveda","Blood pressure","Etio-pathogenesis"],"doi":"10.1016/j.jaim.2017.10.004"},{"title":"An ayurvedic evaluation & treatment of multiple myeloma: A case report","publication_info":[{"name":"Abhijeet Sarjerao Shirkande","attributes":["Department of Dravyaguna (Ayurvedic Materia Medica & Pharmacology), Dr. D.

Graded doses of Chandraprabha vati (50, 100 and 200Â mg/kg) were administered orally for 7 days to normal and alloxan-hyperglycemic rats (65Â mg/kg, intravenously), and to glucose loaded normal rats for oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Fasting plasma glucose levels were assessed on different time intervals along with plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Metformin (500Â mg/kg, orally) was used as standard drug.","","Results","","Chandraprabha vati did not cause any significant reduction in plasma glucose levels of normal rats (pÂ >Â 0.05) but normalized the impaired glucose tolerance at 60 and 120 min (pÂ <Â 0.05âpÂ <Â 0.001) in OGTT when compared to vehicle control.

Management aims towards prevention of infection and to accelerate healing. Acharya Sushruta has given more emphasis on Vrana (wound) and its chikitsa (treatment). Many antiseptic agents which prevent infection are widely used but have no role in accelerating the healing process and are cytotoxic, deleterious to wound healing. In this regard an innovative polyherbomineral formulation Pentabark Kashaya (PK)was formulated to assess acute dermal toxicity and woundhealing activity.","","Objective","","To explore the wound healing efficacy of novel Ayurveda Formulation i.e Pentabark Kashaya in Wistar rats using the excision wound model.","","Materials and method","","Acute dermal toxicity study was carried out on five female Wistar rats by following the OECD guideline 434 and signs of toxicity were assessed for the period of 14 days. Wound healing activitywas assessed on the excision wound model. 18 male Wistar rats were procured for the study and divided into three groups (nÂ =Â 6 in each group). The test group was treated with application of PK, standard group with Povidone iodine solution 5% and control group with distilled water. The parameters assessed were epithelialization period, wound contraction rate, wound closure day and swab test for microbial load for the period of 21 days. Statistical analysis was done by using one way ANOVA and Tukeys HSD to assess changes in between three groups at each time point.","","Results","","No signs of acute dermal toxicity were seen, which proved that PK is safe for application. Significant results were seen in the parameters of wound healing like period of epithelialization and wound closure day. Percentage of wound contraction rate was increased in test group when compared to other groups. Histopathology of skin showed marked changes in re-epithelialization, dermal fibroblast, dermal fibrocytes in test group when compared to control group.","","Conclusion","","PK is safe for application and it is effective in wound healing.","","Clinical Trial Registration No.: Not applicable."],"license_agreement":"This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).","keywords":["Pentabark kashaya","Ayurveda","Vrana","Dermal toxicity","Wound healing"],"doi":"10.1016/j.jaim.2022.100602"},{"title":"Ayurveda biology- the road not trodden","publication_info":"Kalpana Joshi","PMCID":"PMCID: PMC10307822","abstract_link":"None","article_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10307822/?report=classic","pdf_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10307822/pdf/main.pdf","abstract_text":"None","license_agreement":"None","keywords":"None","doi":"None"},{"title":"Effects of Bilwa-Lajadi syrup in emesis gravidarum â an exploratory single arm open labeled trial","publication_info":[{"name":"Deepika Singh","attributes":["Department of Prasuti Tantra and Stree Roga, SCPM Ayurvedic Medical College and Hospital, Gonda, 271003, U.P., India"],"email":"deepika.sbri@gmail.com"},{"name":"Vasudevan Asokan","attributes":["Department of Prasuti Tantra and Stree Roga, Parul Institute of Ayurveda, Limda, Waghodia, Vadodara, 391760, Gujarat, India"],"email":null},{"name":"Gayathri Bhat NV","attributes":["Department of Prasuti Tantra and Stree Roga, Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara College of Ayurveda and Hospital, Hassan, 573201, Karnataka, India"],"email":null},{"name":"Prathima Jain","attributes":["Department of Prasuti Tantra and Stree Roga, Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara College of Ayurveda and Hospital, Hassan, 573201, Karnataka, India"],"email":null}],"PMCID":"PMCID: PMC8814406","abstract_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8814406/?report=abstract","article_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8814406/?report=classic","pdf_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8814406/pdf/main.pdf","abstract_text":["Background","","Emesis gravidarum is a common obstetrical problem affecting 50â80% of pregnant women during their first trimester which begins in the morning and frequently continues throughout the day; considered as one of the Vyakta Garbha Lakshana in Ayurveda.

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic illness that has major long-term implications for individuals suffering from the disease as well as the health-care system as a whole. Modifications in diet, exercise, and lifestyle are all important factors in successful treatment of type 2 diabetes and are incorporated into the ancient Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda.","","Review Summary: This review summarizes the available evidence for the use of Ayurvedic therapies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. For the treatment of type 2 diabetes, Ayurvedic practices primarily emphasizes the use of herbal supplements; however, exercise, weight management, and various supplemental procedures are included in Ayurvedic practices. The goal of Ayurvedic practices on the treatment of type 2 diabetes like in Western medicine focuses on bringing the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value into a therapeutic range. Where Ayurveda differs is that it looks at the functionality of a person in the context of striking a balance between the life forces or doshas that each individual possesses. Finally, this article includes a case study received from AyurVAID clinic in Bangalore, India that details the specific Ayurvedic intervention used in a patient, bringing his HbA1c from a level of 11.2 to 5.7 over the course of 9 months.","","Conclusion","","Patients with type 2 diabetes may inquire about current complementary and alternative therapies available for the treatment of their disease. Awareness of such modalities is necessary for effective patient counseling and care. The benefits of offering a wide array of treatment options include possible reduction of HbA1c and of comorbidities with adjunct use of supplements and mindâbody practices."],"license_agreement":"Creative Commons Non Commercial CC BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).","keywords":["Ayurveda","Ayurvedic","diabetes","diet","lifestyle","type 2 diabetes mellitus"],"doi":"10.1177/2164956119861094"},{"title":"Ayurveda fundamentals and science â A perspective","publication_info":"Basavaraj Ramappa Tubaki, Buduru Sreenivasa Prasad","PMCID":"PMCID: PMC10468022","abstract_link":"None","article_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10468022/?report=classic","pdf_link":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10468022/pdf/AYU-43-65.pdf","abstract_text":"None","license_agreement":"None","keywords":"None","doi":"None"},{"title":"Ninety days repeated dose oral toxicity study of Makaradhwaja in Wistar rats","publication_info":[{"name":"Shrirang Jamadagni","attributes":[],"email":"shrirangb@gmail.com"},{"name":"Pallavi Shrirang Jamadagni","attributes":[],"email":null},{"name":"Rajendra Kumar Singh","attributes":[],"email":null},{"name":"Sachchidanand Upadhyay","attributes":[],"email":null},{"name":"Sudesh N.

Epigenetics refers to the external modification of DNA that turns genes on and off, affecting gene expression. This occurs without changes in the basic structure of the DNA. This gene expression can have transgenerational effects. The major factors that cause epigenetic changes are lifestyle and behavior, diet and digestion, stress, and environmental factors. Ayurveda addresses these factors, thereby affecting the Deha (body) Prakriti (psychophysiological constitution), which corresponds to the phenotype, and indirectly the Janma (birth) Prakriti, which corresponds to the genotype. Thus, it is proposed that epigenetics is an important mechanism of Ayurveda.

The child suffers from intense itching, grittiness, discharge, redness, lacrimation, photophobia, and so on, thereby, decreasing his learning hours. The troublesome features are aggravated in the spring season / hot climate that lasts for years together and rarely persists after adolescence. Mast cell stabilizers, topical Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids are the available treatment options that too with symptomatic relief and potential side effects, which limits the long-term use of these medicines. The clinical picture of vernal keratoconjunctivitis / spring catarrh is very similar to Kaphaja Abhishyanda, and Triyushnadi Anjana Bhaishajya Ratnavali (B.R.), and its treatment was clinically tried on the patients attending the Netra Roga OPD of the R.G. Government P.G. Ayurveda College Hospital at Paprola (H.P.). A proper protocol and performa was adopted with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the first phase, a pilot study was conducted on 38 clinically diagnosed patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and it gave 100% relief in photophobia, foreign body (FB) sensation, and lacrimation, with marked relief in other features. Encouraged by this pilot work, Triyushnadi Anjana (TA) and 2% sodium cromoglycate (mast cell stabilizer) eye drops in the second-phase clinical trial on 32 patients were tried clinically to evaluate the comparative efficacy. In the second clinical trial, the patients were randomly divided into two groups and Group I was given sodium cromoglycate 2% eye drops and Group II was given TA. The outcome of this study verified the results of the first phase pilot study, and on comparison of the results of the two groups in the second clinical study it was observed that the TA-treated group showed better results. Transient irritation in the eyes was reported by all patients after application of TA, which was relieved by keeping the eyes closed for a few minutes. None of the patients reported any adverse action of the trial drug.

There is no definite treatment in contemporary medical science but the principle-based Ayurvedic approach has been proved to be effective. We present a case of PsE treated for 3 months with Ayurvedic herbomineral preparations and dietary restrictions for non-vegetarian and dairy items. As per the Ayurvedic diagnostic view, the presented case is correlated with Audumbara Kushtha and Ekakushtha due to their intricate features. Thus, Ayurvedic approaches were directed to eliminate vitiated doshas responsible for acute exacerbation of Kushtha (â¼dermatitis) and to maintain equilibrium among them. The patient was initially considered as a case of Saam stage of Kushtha with Pitta-Rakta-Vata predominance. Thus, management was planned into different domains-treatment of Saam stage of Kushtha, Vyadhipratyanika chikitsa (â¼disease antagonistic treatment), Rasayana intervention (â¼Immunomodulation therapy) and Ayurvedic drugs were given accordingly. The assessment was done based on subjective parameters and PASI score. The patient was followed for about one and half year without any complication and relapse.

It is due to the breakdown of RBC's (which release bilirubin into the blood) and the immaturity of newborns liver (which cannot effectively metabolize the bilirubin and prepare it for excretion into the urine). Increased bilirubin production, reduced hepatic clearance and enhanced enterohepatic circulation are the sole causes of increased prevalence of jaundice in newborn. The science of Ayurveda is supposed to add a step in order to understand the pathophysiology of neonatal jaundice that have resemblance with clinical entity of kamala (jaundice) mentioned in Kashyapa Samhita. The concept of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in Ayurveda can be understood in the context of Pittaja stanya dushti along with the physiological variations in the newborns leading to the raised level of unconjugated bilirubin. Therefore, the patho-physiology should be known by a pediatrician in Ayurveda based on the involvement of dosha, dhatu, mala and srotas.

However, phenotypic heterogeneity amongst the diseased and healthy poses a major challenge for identification markers for risk stratification and early actionable interventions. In Ayurveda, individuals are phenotypically stratified into seven constitution types based on multisystem phenotypes termed âPrakritiâ. It enables the prediction of health and disease trajectories and the selection of health interventions. We hypothesize that exome sequencing in healthy individuals of phenotypically homogeneous Prakriti types might enable the identification of functional variations associated with the constitution types. Exomes of 144 healthy Prakriti stratified individuals and controls from two genetically homogeneous cohorts (north and western India) revealed differential risk for diseases/traits like metabolic disorders, liver diseases, and body and hematological measurements amongst healthy individuals. These SNPs differ significantly from the Indo-European background control as well. Amongst these we highlight novel SNPs rs304447 (IFIT5) and rs941590 (SERPINA10) that could explain differential trajectories for immune response, bleeding or thrombosis. Our method demonstrates the requirement of a relatively smaller sample size for a well powered study. This study highlights the potential of integrating a unique phenotyping approach for the identification of predictive markers and the at-risk population amongst the healthy."],"license_agreement":"Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Unlike modern medicine, Ayurveda is based upon tridoshas (Vata, pitta, and Kapha) and Prakriti. On the other hand, the research of all the genes involved at the proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptome levels are referred to as genomics. Geoclimatic regions (deshanupatini), familial characteristics (kulanupatini), and ethnicity (jatiprasakta) have all been shown to affect phenotypic variability. The combination of genomics with Ayurveda known as ayurgenomics provided new insights into tridosha that may pave the way for precision medicine (personalized medicine). Through successful coordination of âomics,â Prakriti-based treatments can help change the existing situation in health care. Prakriti refers to an individualâs behavioral trait, which is established at the moment of birth and cannot be fully altered during oneâs existence. Ayurvedic methodologies are based on three Prakriti aspects: aushadhi (medication), vihara (lifestyle), and ahara (diet). A foundation of Prakriti-based medicine, preventative medicine, and improvement of life quality with longevity can be accomplished through these ayurvedic characteristics. In this perspective, we try to understand prakritiâs use in personalized medicine, and how to integrate it with programs for drug development and discovery."],"license_agreement":"This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY).
